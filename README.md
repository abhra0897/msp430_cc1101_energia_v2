### CC1101 MSP430 Energia Library v2

Last updated (18 May, 2020)

#### Note
This is the 2nd version of my first driver library of CC1101 for MSP430 (on energia framework, similar to Arduino). This version is almost entirely different from the previous version. Now it supports al the frequency ranges, has many more communication modes, and lots of other features.

##### If you want to communicate between a MSP430 and an Arduino (AVR based), use this library for MSP430 and SpaceTeddy's library for Arduino (https://github.com/SpaceTeddy/CC1101).

This is done based on the SpaceTeddy's CC1101-Arduino library. I added the hardware support for MSP430 and memory optimized the code whereever possible. The library supports FRAM series MSP430 launchpads: EXP-MSP430FR5739, MSP430FR5969, and MSP430FR6989. The EXP430G2 launchpad with MSP430G2553 MCU is also supported. It should also work with any MSP430G2x53 and MSP430G2x13 MCU.
( Maybe it will work with MSP430G2452 too? )
The supported MCU (and launchpad) list is given below.

#### Download
Download this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/):

```
https://github.com/abhra0897/msp430_cc1101_energia_v2.git
```

#### Install
Put this folder in your Energia libraries folder. Restart Energia. Then load the examples from "File-> Examples-> CC1101_MSP430_energia_v2" (note you need two radios to test functionality, a reciever and a transmitter).

#### Pinouts
For each launchpad, reference [this pin description image of the CC1101](http://www.kooing.com/image/cache/data/CC1101_3-500x500.jpg). The proper orientation is with the antenna facing to your right, with the text "RF1100SE" in the correct orientation.

#### General description of RF packet

```
-> pkt_len [1byte] | rx_addr [1byte] | tx_addr [1byte] | payload data [1..60bytes]
```

pkt_len = count of bytes which shall transfered over air (rx_addr + tx_addr + payload data)<br />
rx_addr = address of device, which shall receive the message (0x00 = broadcast to all devices)<br />
tx_addr = transmitter or my address. the receiver should know who has sent a message.<br />
payload = 1 to 60 bytes payload data.<br />

TX Bytes example:<br />
-> 0x06 0x03 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03<br />

#### Basic configuration

use **uint8_t CC1100::begin(volatile uint8_t &My_addr)** always as first configuration step. This function returns the device address.

##### Device address

you should set a unique device address for the transmitter and a unique device address for the receiver.
This can be done with **void CC1100::set_myaddr(uint8_t addr)**.

i.E. -> TX = 0x01 ; RX = 0x03

##### Modulation modes

the following modulation modes can be set by **void CC1100::set_mode(uint8_t mode)**. Transmitter and receiver must have the same Mode setting.

```
1 = GFSK_1_2_kb
2 = GFSK_38_4_kb
3 = GFSK_100_kb
4 = MSK_250_kb
5 = MSK_500_kb
6 = OOK_4_8_kb
```

##### ISM frequency band

you can set a frequency operation band by **void CC1100::set_ISM(uint8_t ism_freq)** to make it compatible with your hardware.

```
1 = 315
2 = 433
3 = 868
4 = 915
```
